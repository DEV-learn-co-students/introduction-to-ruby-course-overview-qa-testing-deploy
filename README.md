## Introduction to Ruby Course Overview

We're glad you're here learning with us. Start your coding journey with us and learn the basics of Ruby so that by the end you'll be able to build a Tic Tac Toe command line application game. Not sure what a command line application is? You're in the right course then, and we'll cover that along with a lot of other topics. 

You'll learn about variables, methods, logic and conditionals, and then we'll dive into object oriented programming. Throughout the course you'll be working on labs where you'll build a Tic Tac Toe from the ground up. 

Take time reading through the lessons. Some of the labs you encounter will be straightforward while others will be more challenging. Learning to program is hard and we don't dumb it down for you. Sometimes you might find yourself googling for the best way to do something, and we've designed this curriculum so that you do that. Learning how to learn and find answers is a big part of the coding journey. But any time you're stuck, also know that you can use the Ask a Question feature in Learn and we'll be here to help you out!

Happy coding!
